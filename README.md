# Stage 2/4: Star quality
## Description
Now, letâ€™s make our program more versatile. In this stage, you will write a program that creates a name tag for unique first and last names.

## Objectives
Your program should read first and last names from standard input and then output them in a frame. The name tag should contain the first and last name with a single space between them, a single space at the beginning, and another space at the end.

The frame should consist of asterisk symbols `*`. Remember about single spaces between the border of the tag and the personal name.

## Examples

```

<b>Example 1</b><i>, when the user inputs</i> `Nikola Tesla`:
